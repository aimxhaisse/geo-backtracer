# Configuration file for the Geo Backtracer.

# The backtracer can be of the following types:
#
#
# - "primary": Main handler of the database, performs all write
#   operations (pushing points, clearing user history, garbage
#   collection). There can be a single primary instance per
#   database.
#
# - "seeker": Read-only handler of the database, given a user
#   identifier, retrieves correlations in the database. There can
#   be multiple seeker instances per database.
#
# - "standalone": Combines the two other types in the same process.
instance_type: "seeker"

db:
  # Path to the database, if empty, a temporary database is created
  # and deleted at exit (used for testing).
  path: data/

gc:
  # Retention period in days, points older than this number of days
  # are automatically deleted from the database. Changing this value
  # has immediate effect on all existing points.
  retention_period_days: 15

  # Delay in seconds between two GC pass; time between passes can be
  # longer than this, as this delay is between the end of a pass and
  # the beginning of another.
  delay_between_rounds_sec: 3600
