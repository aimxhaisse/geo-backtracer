# Configuration file for a worker.
#
# This is the configuration file of a worker instance for the Geo
# Backtracer. Each worker owns it own database (a shard) and is the
# sole reader and writer to it. Each worker exposes a gRPC API used by
# other Geo Backtracer components (push points in a shard, get
# correlations for a user, delete all data of a user).

instance_type: "worker"

db:
  # Path to the database, if empty, a temporary database is created
  # and deleted at exit (used for testing).
  path: data/

network:
  # Host to listen to; in a cluster setup, it typically is the private
  # network interface.
  host: "0.0.0.0"

  # Port to listen to; in a cluster setup, each worker on a machine
  # needs to use a unique port number.
  port: 7000

gc:
  # Retention period in days, points older than this number of days
  # are automatically deleted from the database. Changing this value
  # has immediate effect on all existing points.
  retention_period_days: 15

  # Delay in seconds between two GC pass; time between passes can be
  # longer than this, as this delay is between the end of a pass and
  # the beginning of another.
